Below are certain optimal strategies for protocol health depending on the TWAP of VINYL. 

### TWAP Below 1.0 (VINYL < 1 FTM)

Goal: VINYL is below peg. We want to bring it back to or above peg quickly and sustainably. Continuing holding, buying, or otherwise burning VINYL (through buying CDs (bond), raffles or other future initiatives). 

Step 1: Purchase VINYL to form a VINYL-FTM LP

Step 2:  Stake your VINYL-FTM liquidity pair in the Club to earn TRACKS. 

Step 3: Sell a portion of your reward TRACKS (20%) for VINYL and FTM to create more VINYL-FTM lp.

Step 4: Compound your new VINYL-FTM LP in in the Club

Step 5: Repeat
____

### TWAP Between 1.0 & 2.0 (1 FTM < VINYL < 2 FTM)

Goal: This is the ideal zone for the price of VINYL and we would like to keep it here. Stop selling the VINYL rewards at this point and let the rewards compound. 

Step 1: Purchase VINYL to form an VINYL-FTM LP

Step 2: Stake your VINYL-FTM liquidity pair in the Club to earn TRACKS. 

Step 3: Stake your earned TRACKS in the Studio to earn VINYL.
Do not sell your TRACKS or VINYL as we are compounding to keep the price steady and increase our overall rewards! 

Step 4: Create an LP with your TRACKS and earned VINYL from the Studio and compound into your still Staked VINYL-FTM LP. 

In the future you can stake your VINYL in the single sided pool to earn more TRACKS and or create an VINYL-TRACKS LP (coming soon).

Step 5: Repeat!
_____

### TWAP Above 2.0 (VINYL > 2 FTM)

Goal: This is the zone where we want to encourage responsible profit taking in order to lower the price closer to peg. In other words, bring the price of VINYL down to less than 2 FTM. 

Step 1: buy and stake TRACKS in the Studio

Step 2: Take profits of 20% of Vinyl (optional)
Split remaining TRACKS into to TRACKS-FTM or VINYL-FTM pools

Step 3: Stake your LP in the Club

Step 4: Compound 100% of your TRACKS in the Studio.
