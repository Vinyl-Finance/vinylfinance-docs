# Genesis Pools & Token Allocation

The Vinyl team has decided to utilize Genesis Pools for launch to foster initial protocol liquidity. We believe Genesis pools provide investors with value preservation, shielding them from 'sniper' bots and effectively decentralizing liquidity from being in the hands of a core team.&#x20;

Genesis pools can maximize your VINYL rewards as the highest allocation is offered during the initial expansion phase of the protocol.

In total **40,000 VINYL** will be distributed in this initial expansion phase. 

To participate head to the [Club](https://vinyl.finance/club)!

_Genesis Pool start time was March 12th at 18:00 GMT_
