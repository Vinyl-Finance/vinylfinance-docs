Check out what is in store for the future of Vinyl Finance!
___

## Project Aim
As mentioned in the [team](https://docs.vinyl.finance/team) page the whole Vinyl team is very much into playing records as we are the digital token. So in order to give VINYL tokens [real value and use case](https://docs.vinyl.finance/#what-makes-vinyl-different) we figured what better way than to build our own Vinyl tNFT, tangible NFT, marketplace! The DAO and Dev fund will be contributing directly to this aim. We feel we are uniquely positioned to make this audacious goal a reality with our contacts in the record and music industry. That said we are realistic with the initial vision and have a partnership with one of our favorite boutique, house music labels, [Nice Timing](https://www.realnicetiming.com/). They have the inventory and the distribution methods to make this reality while we work on the tNFT marketplace side of it. 

Now that we have nailed the launched more info on this partnership to can shared in soon as we build the tNFT marketplace.
