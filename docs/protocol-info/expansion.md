Expansion Phase is when the time weighted average of VINYL is above the 1.00 peg to FTM.
:::

<!-- # Expansion Phase -->
After the Genesis Pools end, main protocol launches and the expansion phase begins minting TRACKS and takes over the minting of VINYL. This consists of the staking in the [Club](https://vinyl.finance/club)'s TRACKS reward pools with LP pairs and staking TRACKS in the [Studio](https://vinyl.finance/studio) to earn more VINYL.

There is also the [Shop](https://vinyl.finance/shop) where CDs, aka bonds, are sold and redeemed for a premium. All three of these entities, the Club, Studio and Shop work together to ensure a healthy seigniorage protocol for maintaining VINYL's 1:1 peg to FTM.

## Vinyl Expansion

### The Studio
_The Studio opens for TRACKS staking on March 15th at 18 GMT_

After the genesis pools the [Studio](https://vinyl.finance/studio) (boardroom) is where fresh VINYL is printed for staked TRACKS. At the beginning of every epoch, if the time weighted average price (TWAP) of VINYL is greater than 1.01, new  VINYL will be minted. The amount of new  VINYL distributed depends on the current circulating supply of  VINYL.&#x20;

The first 12 epochs (3 days) after the Studio launches will have stable 4.5% emissions. _subject to change_

_Note: an epoch is 6 hours_

Circulating Supply | Vinyl minted
-- | --
Below 250k | 4.5%
Below 500K | 4.0%
Below 1M | 3.5%
Below 2M | 3.0%
Below 4M | 2.5%
Below 8M | 2.0%
Below 16M | 1.5%
Below 32M | 1.25%
Above 32M | 1.0%

#### Mechanics
There is a 4 epoch lockup upon staking TRACKS in the Studio for withdrawals and a 2 epoch lock up for claiming the VINYL rewards. Please note: upon claiming rewards the lock up withdrawal timer is reset.
