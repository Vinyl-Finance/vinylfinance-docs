# Contraction Phase

:::info
Contraction Phase is when the time weighted average of VINYL is under the 1.00 peg to FTM.
:::

This phase is to ensure VINYL maintains its 1:1 peg with FTM. It is perfectly normal and expected for the price to fluctuate above and below 1 FTM after the excitement of launch wears off. This is in fact the sign of a healthy, maturing protocol.

VINYL is burned in order to maintain the 1:1 FTM peg in exchange for CDs. 

_Yeah, don't really care for cd's either but let's face it... they made access to music more accessible than vinyl. That said, vinyl clearly always makes a pop culture resurgence!_ Expect the same from the tokens. **Swapping VINYL for CDs helps the longevity of the protocol by assisting to maintain the peg**. Plus you get some fat premiums upon redemption!

## Purchasing CDs, aka Bonds
The [Shop](https://vinyl.finance/shop) is where CDs, aka bonds, are sold and redeemed for a premium. It is open for business when the last epoch's TWAP, time weighted average price, for VINYL compared to FTM is under 1.00. 

_Note: an epoch is 6 hours_

## Redeeming CDs for VINYL
CDs can be redeemed for VINYL when the last epoch's TWAP is above 1.00 again. There is a premium for those vinyl enthusiasts that redeem CDs when the TWAP is greater than 1.1. The premium is proportional to the last epoch's TWAP above 1.1.
