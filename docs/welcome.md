## Our Origin Story

Inspired by the original idea behind Basis (and it's predecessors bDollar and soup), our team set out to build upon the success of **tomb.finance** and subsequent **2omb.finance** with the creation of Vinyl.

**Vinyl Finance is a multi-token protocol pegged to Fantom** that consists of the following three tokens:&#x20;

\-Vinyl ($VINYL)

\-Tracks, aka Vinyl Shares ($TRACKS)&#x20;

\-CD, Vinyl Bonds ($CD).

## What makes Vinyl different?

Stage 2 of Vinyl Finance is tNFT (tangible NFT) marketplace where VINYL is the native token to allow for the purchase of underground house music wax and shipment worldwide. We already have a partnership with a US-based record label and distributor, [Nice Timing](https://www.realnicetiming.com/), lined up to make this a reality. This means a real use case for the token in addition to proving additional liquidity to the Fantom Opera ecosystem. Please reference our [roadmap](/docs/protocol-info/roadmap) for up to date information on innovations to come!
