As stated in the [KYC](/docs/security/kyc) section, we take operational security and integrity very seriously. For your safety we have removed the team's ability to mint all tokens of the protocol ([VINYL](/docs/protocol-info/tokens#vinyl-vinyl-token), [TRACKS](/docs/protocol-info/tokens#tracks-vinyl-share), and [CD](/docs/protocol-info/tokens#cd-vinyl-bonds)s) by renouncing ownership of them. This means that only the Treasury contract has the ability to mint new VINYL and CD tokens. This also, means the amount of TRACKS is finite. There will never been another TRACK minted because no one and no contract has the ability to do so. 

The practice of protocols renouncing token contract ownership is a best practice and ought to be standard practice for all legitimate projects. We look forward to making income along side you, not from you.
