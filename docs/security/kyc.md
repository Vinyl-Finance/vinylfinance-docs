We take our security and integrity very seriously which is why we have taken the effort to have the team  [KYC](https://www.apeoclock.com/launch/vinyl-finance-genesis-pools-launch/) verified. This means that a third party, in our case [Ape O'Clock](https://www.apeoclock.com/launch/vinyl-finance-genesis-pools-launch/), has verified our identity and will disclose the our local law enforcement if any malicious activities occur, i.e. we steal funds by minting infinite tokens and taking all the liquidity. While not only is that immoral but in, fact, we have removed the team's ability to mint all tokens of the protocol (VINYL, TRACKS, and CDs) by [renouncing](/docs/security/renounced) ownership of them.
