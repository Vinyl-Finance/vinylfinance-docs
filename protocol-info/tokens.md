# Tokens

## VINYL

The VINYL token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain the VINYL peg to 1 FTM token over time.

Note that VINYL **actively pegs via the algorithm.** It **does not mean** it will be valued at 1 FTM at all times as it is not officially collateralized.&#x20;

## TRACKS

TRACKS are one of the ways to measure the value of the Vinyl protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain VINYL close to peg.

TRACKS have a **maximum total supply of 50,000** tokens distributed as follows:

* DAO Allocation: 4500 TRACKS vested linearly 300 days
* Team Allocation: 4500 TRACKS vested linearly over 300 days
* Rewards: 41000 TRACKS are allocated for incentivizing Liquidity Providers in two shares pools for the next year
* Initial mint: 1 TRACKS minted upon contract creation for initial pool
