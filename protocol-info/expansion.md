# Expansion

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time weighted average price (TWAP) of VINYL is greater than 1.01, new  VINYL will be minted in the Studio. The amount of new  VINYL distributed depends on the current circulating supply of  VINYL.&#x20;

The first 28 epochs (7 days) after the Studio (boardroom) launches will have stable 4.5% emissions.
