# Genesis Pools & Token Allocation

The Vinyl team has decided to utilize Genesis Pools for launch, similar to the origins of TOMB and BASED to foster initial protocol liquidity. We believe Genesis pools provide investors with value preservation, shielding them from 'sniper' bots and effectively decentralizing liquidity from being in the hands of a core team.&#x20;

Genesis pools can maximize your VINYL rewards as the highest allocation is offered during the initial expansion phase of the protocol.
