# Genesis Pools & Token Allocation

The Vinyl team has decided to utilize Genesis Pools for launch, similar to the origins of TOMB and BASED to foster initial protocol liquidity. We believe Genesis pools provide investors with value preservation, shielding them from 'sniper' bots and effectively decentralizing liquidity from being in the hands of a core team.&#x20;

Participate in Genesis pools to maximize VINYL rewards, by earning the highest allocation during the initial expansion phase of the protocol.

## Genesis Pools Timeline

The Genesis Pool will last for 3 days and be followed by four days of the Vinyl Reward Pool.&#x20;

### **Genesis pool (72 hrs)**

* Genesis pools opens
* Stake FTM, 2OMB, or USDC for up to 72 hours to participate
* Genesis pools closes

**Pools:** FTM, 2OMB, USDC

**Total Vinyl tokens:**  30,000

### **Vinyl reward pool (96 hrs)**

* After the Genesis pool closes, the Vinyl reward pool opens
* Stake your VINYL/FTM LP and accrue the remaining reward supply of Vinyl, distributed linearly across the reward pool timeline.&#x20;
