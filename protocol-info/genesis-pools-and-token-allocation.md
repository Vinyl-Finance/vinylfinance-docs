# Genesis Pools & Token Allocation

The Vinyl team has decided to utilize Genesis Pools for launch, similar to the origins of TOMB and BASED to foster initial protocol liquidity. We believe Genesis pools provide investors with value preservation, shielding them from 'sniper' bots and effectively decentralizing liquidity from being in the hands of a core team.&#x20;

**Genesis pool (72 hrs)**

* Genesis pools opens
* Stake FTM, 2OMB, or USDC for up to 72 hours to participate
* Earn Genesis expansion rewards in Vinyl, the highest allocation for any phase of the protocol
* Genesis pools closes
