# Team

We are a team of professional developers that work primarily on decentralized identity. Over the years we have created, scaled, and managed many projects that live on and off chain. Being major fans of Fantom Opera and seeing the need for increased FTM liquidity in order to facilitate greater adoption we have participated in Tomb and countless of its forks. Our experience with the protocol combined with our technical prowess uniquely positions us to better server you, the Vinyl Fan, and the healthy longevity of the protocol itself.&#x20;

Not to mention we have a soft spot for the warm sound of dropping the needle on some wax.&#x20;

With :heart:,&#x20;
